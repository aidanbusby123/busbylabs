        <p>What if there is no escape?
        <br>
        <br>
        The eternalist point of view postulates that all points in time exist simultaneously, past present and future. The natural conclusion to be made is that each and every one of us is forever damned to live the same life for all eternity.<br>
        First, we must tackle the question of why am I me. Why is any one of us who we are? why are we not someone else? because then we would not be ourselves. We exist and cannot escape our existence because as long as there is an information system that is our mind that exists, that being can only be as itself. To be as another being of another information system would necesitate a swap in being, in which case no change would be detected for the end configurations would become that of their corresponding neighbor. Simply put, if Alice were to suddenly appear as Bob and Bob suddenly as Alice, Bob would have to become Alice. Thus, Alice would notice no change, for Bob would by defninition have to turn into an indistinguishable version of Alice that continues her existence as an information system. The same can be said for Bob.<br>
        <br>
        If humans are information systems, then let us define an information system absent of information as Death. Let us say that Alice dies; her information system is transformed to one congruent to Death. However, from the eternalist point of view, Alice prime, who lives some nonzero amount of time before Alice becomes congruent to Death, still exists, and Death cannot exist as Alice prime and Alice prime cannot exist as Death by the above argument. In addition, Alice prime is not congruent to Alice, who exists now as Death. Dead Alice does not exist, but Alice prime does, and Alice prime is alive. By induction, as Alice prime becomes death we can find another Alice who is alive. Thus, some instance of Alice will always be alive, will always exist as herself, and cannot switch forms.

        Yet, why cannot Death continue the existence of Alice? after all, any two Alices, Alice 1 and Alice 2, from two points in her lifetime will be different, so why not be there some way Alice continues on through Death? as we have defined Death as the absense of an information system, there is no way to exist, and this cannot be. Of course, some information will indeed be left over, but it will be too sparse, noisy, and uncoordinated for organized existence. But then, when does Alice become Death? the process, after all, is not abrupt. Yet, the lines that divide each one of our existences are not completely clear drawn either, but their relative clarity outshines the noise. The information shared between two individuals is negligible compared to the information shared between each one of their lobes, and thus their consciousness is diluted no more than the contact of hot air with skin does. Despite phenomenological significance, which exists only because the mind creates it.

        There then must be some period of traversal to the world of Death, and in this period the arrow of time breakes down, becomes messy, disorganized, but with this consciousness fades. Yet as the candle fades, its predecessors persist. There is no moment where the candle goes out and reinstates itself through a younger version of itself. That gradual descent into the void offers clarity on the contrast between the void and the state of being, and it is this relative nature that allows for a state of being to exist. And if they are to be incongrous, there must be some path, some delta, some way in which they can have a difference, and death is the transversal through the continous path from meaning to no meaning, life to death. In the end, all is fuzzy, but with enough detail out of this fuzz comes sharpness and clarity. As sharpness and clarity fade, as does the state of being that defines you and prevents you from being another being.

        And if previous you exists, which it does under the eternalist argument, you go back to you. At every point up until you reach Death, you will be closest to these previous versions of you. Even in increasing disorder and chaos and entropy, that thermodynamic connection persists. None of the information that characterized you actually makes it to Death, for Death has no information. This information is continued in the form of heat and other physical phenomenon. The final firings of neurons as you take your last breath will always find you closer to your being than another, and so up until Death that information connection persists. Thus through dying you cannot become another soul.

        You are forever confined, forever damned, forever trapped. Despite this tragic news, recieve protection from the simple fact that you never can know that which comes from the future,and through this ignorance comes a freedom to give you strength.
