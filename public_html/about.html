            <h1>About</h1>

            <p> My name is Aidan Busby. I am a 17 year old Senior at West Seattle High School. This website is a documentation of some of my STEM-related ventures. 
                I have a variety of interests, but I am most focused on mathematics, computer science, and related fields like Engineering, which are the focus of this site. I also have a passion for the humanities,
                namely philosophy, but this is not the current focus of my blog.

                <h3>Tesla Coils</h3>
                <p>
                I've built a few Tesla coils, which have been the main focus of this site given their physical nature and blog-worthiness.

                <h3>Rockets</h3>
                <p>
                I've also been into rockets - I'm a member of the rocketry club at my school, and was the lead programmer of our active control system for the 2025 
                American Rocketry Challenge. We are currently working on improving our system for 2026!
                </p>

                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <p>
                I love to program. My main interests are in AI, networking, and low-level systems. I have built a mostly-functional NES emulator, an encrypted messaging client, and a number of other 
                small projects that you can find on my GitHub. Recently I have gone deeper into more application-focused programming, designing our
                active control system for Rocketry and building an AI-powered SAT preparation service called <a href="https://rocketprep.ai">RocketPrepAI</a>.
                
                </p>

                <h3>Math</h3>
                <p>
                I've had a passion for math for a while now. My favorite competition is the USAMTS, which gives you a month to solve proof-based problems. I'm not a big fan of
                the rapid-fire kind of questions you see on the AMC, I prefer the deeper thinking that proof based maths asks for.
