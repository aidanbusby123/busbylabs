            <h1>About</h1>

            <p> My name is Aidan Busby. I am a 17 year old Junior at West Seattle High School. This website is a documentation of some of my STEM-related ventures. 
                I have a variety of interests, but my greatest ones are mathematics, physics, and engineering. I also have a passion for Spanish and music, but these 
                are not the focus of this website.

                <h3>Tesla Coils</h3>
                <p>
                Currently, I have been focused/refocused on programming and electrical engineering. I have built a couple of Tesla coils, and those are fun, but I think
                I've come to the realization that while high voltage electronics are arguable super <i>badass</i>, they aren't really my passion per se. My first real coil 
                I started working on the end of sophomore year- I can get some pretty good arcs (like 8 inches), but the primary coil is pretty badly designed- I intend to make 
                a new one when I can find a weekend where I don't have five hours of APUSH homework to deal with.

                <h3>Rockets</h3>
                <p>
                Ive also been into rockets - I'm a member of the rocketry club at my school, and was the lead programmer of our active control system for the 2025 
                American Rocketry Challenge.

                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <p>
                One of my recurring interests has been programming. In middle school, I spent a fair amount of time learning how to program in C- still my favorite 
                language, but I've always had a problem where I will start a project, then fail to finish it. Its also hard to find time to program sometimes, especially
                when you have a ton of homework. Some of my notable projects include a 6502 emulator I wrote in C in middle school and a <i>super</i> buggy encrypted messenger (also need to finish this one. I call it Semphore Messenger, you can find it 
                on my github <a href="https://github.com/aidanbusby123/semaphore-messenger.git">here</a>).
                </p>

                <h3>Math</h3>
                <p>
                I've had a passion for math for a while now. I do like attending local math competitions, but I joined kind of late in the game and don't focus on it as much
                as my other activities- I do love learning about it and applying it, however, but I like to be able to build things (which is why computer science is so appealing
                to me.)
