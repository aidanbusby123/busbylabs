            <h1>About</h1>
            <p> My name is Aidan Busby. This website is a documentation of some of the STEM related ventures that I have found myself working on. I am a 16 year old Junior at West Seattle High School, 
                a casual programmer, and math enthusiast (hoping to qualify for AIME).
