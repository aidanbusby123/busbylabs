    <h1>NEOCONTEXT</h1>
    <p>NeoContext is my latest project in Artificial Intelligence. The goal is to combine evolution with reinforcement learning
        and an appropriate training set to create models capable of general reasoning. I am currently working with Hierarchical Temporal Memory,
        a brain-based AI architecture that mimics the neocortex, to explore this area. This web page is in its very early stages, and will be updated as I develop the project further.

        Update 11/15/25: Have successfully implemented the ClassifierRegion, am able to feed tokens to our model. Now, need to map integer values back to tokens for readibility, and greatly expand our 
        dataset, implement a stop token, and begin evolution architecture.
