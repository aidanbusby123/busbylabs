    <h1>ZVS Flyback Driver</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      ZVS drivers are one of the most powerful and efficient forms of drivers for flyback transformers, capable of producing high current arcs with minimal thermal losses.
      Fyback transformers are a form of high frequency transformers, commonly used in CRT television sets. Unlike traditional transformers, which use AC mains at a frequency of 50-60Hz,
      flyback transformers operate at much higher frequencies, from 15KHz to 50kHz. Flyback transformers can output a wide range of voltages, usually around 20kV, and can run on relatively
      low power. In this project, I used power supplies rated no higher than 12V 5A, and was able to get some nice, hot arcs out of the deal. This efficiency and ability be driven using
      low power DC makes flyback transformers a popular item in the high voltage community, and make a great low power tesla coil supply, as I have also done.

    <h2>Operation</h2>
    <p>
      Flyback transformers require special, high frequency primary AC voltages, so they cannot be run off of AC mains. Because of this, driver capable of supplying these high frequencies
      must be constructed. This is where the ZVS driver comes in. ZVS stands for Zero Voltage Switching, and was invented by Vladmiro Mazilli in 2009. ZVS drivers work by using a pair of
      mosfets to control an LC circuit formed by the primary of the flyback and the capacitor in the ZVS driver.
      <br>
      When a voltage is supplied to the circuit, one of the mosfet's gates is activated. While both mosfets are connected to the driving voltage, one will turn on before the other, because
      no two electrical components are exactly alike, and current will be redirected from the gate of the other mosfet to the rest of the circuit.
      <br>
      When the first mosfet turns on, current will flow through from the voltage source, through the center tap of the primary, and to the drain of the mosfet, which is grounded. This
      charges the tank capacitor. At the same time, current flows from the voltage source at the gate of the deactivated mosfet through the connected fast diode to the drain of the 
      activated mosfet. Once charged, the capacitor will discharge in the opposite direction, preventing further flow of electrical current through the gate of the deactivated mosfet,
      allowing the gate to charge and activate the deactivated mosfet. The other mosfet will deactivate, because current will be redirected from the gate to the drain of the now activated mosfet.
      The cycle repeats over and over, continuosly supply power to the LC circuit.
