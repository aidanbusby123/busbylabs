        <h1>Mini Tesla Coil</h1>
        <p>As an introduction to the world of high voltage engineering, I decided to dive head first into the subject by building a miniature spark-gap tesla coil. It has a 13.875cm long secondary coil, 1.67cm in diameter,
        with about 450 turns. The primary has around 7 3/4 turns of 14 guage house wire, ~6.75 cm in diameter. The secondary tank circuit has a measured resonance frequency of 1.13 MHz, with an old lightbulb covered
        in aluminum tape acting as a capacitor. The primary uses a CRT flyback that I got off ebay as a power supply, and 2 1nf capacitors in series for a primary tank capacitance of 2nf. This endeavor has taken me
        a lot (insert emphasis here) of time, a lot more than it should have. This is partially due to my horrible planning skills, as well as a procrastinating nature and  occasional lack of motivation. It should also
        be noted that this project was, again, a learning experience, and so I did end up making a lot of modifications and complete reworks several times. However, after nearly five months of sluggish progress, I think
        I am in a place where I can confidently say that the project is finished.</p>
        <h2>Theory of Operation</h2>
        <p>A tesla coil is essentially a high voltage transformer whose secondary and primary tank circuits have the same resonance frequency. A tank (or LC) circuit is simply an electrical oscillator that uses a capacitor
        and an inductor to generate sinusoidinal electrical signals. In a tesla coil, both the primary and secondary are a part of their own, seperate tank circuits. However, in a tesla coil, the frequency of these 
        oscillations (the resonance frequency), is equivalent (ideally). This is done by
