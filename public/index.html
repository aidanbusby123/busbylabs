                    A flyback is a high frequency transformer most oftenly found in old CRT television sets. Flybacks can produce tens of thousands of volts
                    at a frequencies around 20KHz. These devices are quite useful for high voltage applications, and are quite fun to play around with. A ZVS (Zero Voltage Switching)
                    driver is one of the most powerful and efficient methods of running a flyback, and is fairly easy to build, as I have done here. Keep in mind that I am not
                    an electrical engineer, so I am not an expert on the subject, but this should act as a good reference material and introduction to flyback transformers.
