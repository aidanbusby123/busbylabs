<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This project uses an infrared distance module, a stepper motor, a stepper
    motor linear slide, and an arduino nano to get detailed 3D scans of an object. 
    The stepper motor is used to turn a rotating disk upon which the target object sits,
    while a stepper motor linear actuator slides the IR sensor along the vertical
    axis, getting the distance from the sensor of each point on the object. The entire
    aparatus is driven with an Arduino Nano and an A4988 stepper motor driver.

<h2>Operation</h2>
<img alt = "circuit diagram">
<p>The brains of the operation is an Arduino Nano. It is perfect for our purposes
    due to its small size and low cost. 
    <br>
    Pins 2-5 are connected to the IN4, IN3, IN2 and IN1 pins on the 28BYJ-48 driver board,
    respectively. Pins 6 and 7 are connected to the STEP and DIR (step and direction)
    pins of the A4988 driver, which is used to control the linear actuator. Finally,
    the A0 pin is hooked up to the output of the SHARP GP2Y0A21SK0F.
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>The SHARP GP2Y0A21SK0F is instrumental to the operation of the scanner. It uses
        the relative luminosity of the IR light reflected off an object to determine its
        distance. We may exploit this in order to get a set of vertices that 
        correspond to the object we are scanning.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>The A4988 is neccessary to drive the linear actuator. There is no standard
        driver for the actuator that I ended up using, so I had to use a universal
        one (the A4988), although this does mean some snipping and soldering.
