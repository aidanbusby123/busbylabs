        <h1>About</h1>
        <p> My name is Aidan Busby. I am a 15 year old at West Seattle High School. I have created this website to detail the various
            STEM related endeavors and projects that I hope to complete throughout my highschool career. I have always been interested in science and technology, and, more recently,
            mathematics, now that I am able to comprehend the fun stuff. I don't have many notable accomplishments of the STEM variety to name, and this website aims to change that.

            I have begun my journey into cool science stuff in the electrical engineering sector, more specifically high voltage. Now, I have learned a lot, <i>especially</i> to 
            <b>always ensure that your high voltage capacitors are properly discharged</b> before jamming your fingers where they shouldn't be (speaking from experience here).

            One of my current hobbies is computer programming. Granted, I don't actually do that much of it, and often find myself sitting on my ass playing stupid mobile games for hours on
            end. But I have come to my senses, for the most part, and have begun to actually do stuff with my life. Getting back to the programming part, I am fairly proficient in C,
            which is currently my favorite programming language (and pretty much the only one that I know), and have made a couple cool things with it. I made a very glitchy IRC
            (Internet Relay Chat) client once that only worked around half the time, but that's still something, right?
