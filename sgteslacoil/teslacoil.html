                <p>This is a 360 Watt spark gap Tesla coil powered by a 12kV neon sign transformer. It was built as my final for AP Physics sophomore year, and yielded some relatively
                    impressive results. This was my first real high voltage build, my first real Tesla coil.
                    The coil uses a 12kV 30mA neon sign transformer that was purchased off ebay, a 0.0095 micro-Farad MMC capacitor bank that I constructed,
                    a Richard-Quick style spark gap, a primary coil made of 5/16 in copper tubing, a 1000 turn secondary that I bought off ebay, and a toroid
                    made of pie tins and aluminum ducting. It has a resonant frequency of 390kHz and a theoretical voltage of 1.5-1.8 million volts.

                <h2>Operation</h2>
                <p>The coil uses a simple spark-gap design. An LC circuit consisting of the primary coil and the MMC capacitor bank is charged using a 12kV 30mA transformer. When the voltage
                    of the MMC bank has reached the breakdown voltage of the air between the electrodes of the spark-gap, the spark-gap breakes, allowing the MMC to discharge through the primary
                    coil. The primary coil acts as an inductor and forms an LC circuit with the capacitor bank, which resonates at a specific frequency, which is dependent on the inductance of
                    the primary and the capacitance of the capacitor bank. This is the <i>primary resonant frequency</i>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The oscillating voltage through the primary coil induces a voltage in the secondary coil. The primary coil and secondary coil act as a step up transformer, with a much higher
                    voltage being induced in the secondary coil.  The secondary coil forms its
                    own LC circuit; The secondary coil is an inductor, and the toroid stores charge, acting as a capacitor with the ground. Thus, the secondary circuit has its own resonant frequency,
                    the <i>secondary resonant frequency.</i>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In a tesla coil, the goal is to match the primary resonant frequency with the secondary resonant frequency. This allows the primary circuit and secondary circuit to resonate,
                    which allows the tesla coil secondary to maximize its voltage. Tesla coils have relatively weak <i>coupling</i> between the primary and secondary (coupling is the measure
                    of how quickly the energy is transfered between coils in a transformer. Lower coupling means more oscillations are needed for the coil to discharge, and thus the sparks are 
                    more continous), instead using resonance to maximize the voltage of the secondary. Optimal performance is reached when the primary and secondary resonant frequencies are 
                    as close as possible.

                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>JavaTC was used to design the Tesla coil. JavaTC is a popular tool used to quickly perform the calculations neccessary to design a working Tesla coil that properly resonates 
                    and doesn't blow up in your face.
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>The secondary coil has a 24" tall secondary of approximately 1,000 turns, with a 3.5" radius. It sits about 18 inches of the ground (12" was used in the JavaTC calculations,
                    but this isn't super critical).
                    <br>
                    The primary coil is a spiral that was designed to begin 3.0" from the center of the secondary ad spiral outwards to a final radius of 7.84", with a total number of turns of
                    7.73. In the actual design, this was not realized due to some design limitations and human error.

                <p>
                    The secondary and primary circuits each have a theoretical resonant frequency of about 390kHz. The secondary uses a toroid with a major diameter of 13" and a minor
                    diameter of 4" as a capacitor, and the primary circuit uses a 0.0095 MMC capacitor bank.
