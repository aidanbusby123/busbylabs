                <p>This is a 360 Watt spark gap Tesla coil powered by a 12kV neon sign transformer. It was built as my final for AP Physics sophomore year, and yielded some relatively
                    impressive results. This was my first real high voltage build, my first real Tesla coil.
                    The coil uses a 12kV 30mA neon sign transformer that was purchased off ebay, a 0.0095 micro-Farad MMC capacitor bank that I constructed,
                    a Richard-Quick style spark gap, a primary coil made of 5/16 in copper tubing, a 1000 turn secondary that I bought off ebay, and a toroid
                    made of pie tins and aluminum ducting. It has a resonant frequency of 390kHz and a theoretical voltage of 1.5-1.8 million volts.
