                <p>This is a 360 Watt spark gap Tesla coil powered by a 12kV neon sign transformer. It was built as my final for AP Physics sophomore year, and yielded some relatively
                    impressive results. This was my first real high voltage build, my first real Tesla coil.
                    The coil uses a 12kV 30mA neon sign transformer that was purchased off ebay, a 0.0095 micro-Farad MMC capacitor bank that I constructed,
                    a Richard-Quick style spark gap, a primary coil made of 5/16 in copper tubing, a 1000 turn secondary that I bought off ebay, and a toroid
                    made of pie tins and aluminum ducting. It has a resonant frequency of 390kHz and a theoretical voltage of 1.5-1.8 million volts.

                <h2>Operation</h2>
                <p>The coil uses a simple spark-gap design. An LC circuit consisting of the primary coil and the MMC capacitor bank is charged using a 12kV 30mA transformer. When the voltage
                    of the MMC bank has reached the breakdown voltage of the air between the electrodes of the spark-gap, the spark-gap breakes, allowing the MMC to discharge through the primary
                    coil. The primary coil acts as an inductor and forms an LC circuit with the capacitor bank, which resonates at a specific frequency, which is dependent on the inductance of
                    the primary and the capacitance of the capacitor bank. This is the <i>primary resonant frequency</i>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The oscillating voltage through the primary coil induces a voltage in the secondary coil. The primary coil and secondary coil act as a step up transformer, with a much higher
                    voltage being induced in the secondary coil.  The secondary coil forms its
                    own LC circuit; The secondary coil is an inductor, and the toroid stores charge, acting as a capacitor with the ground. Thus, the secondary circuit has its own resonant frequency,
                    the <i>secondary resonant frequency.</i>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In a tesla coil, the goal is to match the primary resonant frequency with the secondary resonant frequency. This allows the primary circuit and secondary circuit to resonate,
                    which allows the tesla coil secondary to maximize its voltage. Tesla coils have relatively weak <i>coupling</i> between the primary and secondary (coupling is the measure
                    of how quickly the energy is transfered between coils in a transformer. Lower coupling means more oscillations are needed for the coil to discharge, and thus the sparks are 
                    more continous), instead using resonance to maximize the voltage of the secondary. Optimal performance is reached when the primary and secondary resonant frequencies are 
                    as close as possible.

                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>JavaTC was used to design the Tesla coil. JavaTC is a popular tool used to quickly perform the calculations neccessary to design a working Tesla coil that properly resonates 
                    and doesn't blow up in your face.
                </p>

                    </center>
                </div>
                <p>The secondary coil has a 24" tall secondary of approximately 1,000 turns, with a 3.5" radius. It sits about 18 inches of the ground (12" was used in the JavaTC calculations,
                    but this isn't super critical).
                    <br>
                    The primary coil is a spiral that was designed to begin 3.0" from the center of the secondary coil and spiral outwards to a final radius of 7.84", with a total number of turns of
                    7.73. In the actual design, this was not realized due to some design limitations and human error.

                <p>
                    The secondary and primary circuits each have a theoretical resonant frequency of about 390kHz. The secondary uses a toroid with a major diameter of 13" and a minor
                    diameter of 4" as a capacitor, and the primary circuit uses a 0.0094 micro-Farad MMC capacitor bank.

                <h2>Construction</h2>
                <p>
                    June 1 2024
                    <br>
                    Today I began the construction of the capacitor bank. The capacitor bank consists of two rows of ten capacitors each, in parallel with one another, for a total of twenty 
                    capacitors. Each capacitor is 0.047 uF rated at 3,000 volts, for a total rated voltage of 30,000 volts and a capacitance of 0.0094 uF. This matches up well with the 
                    recommended LTR (larger than resonance) capacitor bank size for my setup of 0.0099 uF. Because the voltages in a Tesla coil primary circuit will rise higher than the
                    output voltage of the transformer, and can peak at several times this voltage for various reasons, it is smart to have a capacitor bank with a slightly higher capacitance
                    than the resonant value in order to avoid overloading the system. This puts much less stress on the transformer and capacitor bank and reduces the chances of 
                    damaging the Tesla coil over continous use.
                    <br>
                    I began construction by marking up the lexan that I bought at the hardware store using a ruler and permanent marker. After marking everything, I began drilling the holes
                    for the four 0.25" metal bolts that go in the corners of the three pieces of lexan to hold them together. I just taped all three together and only marked up the top sheet
                    of lexan. After this was done, I removed the two other sheets from the pile and drilled the twenty holes for the capacitor leads. I used a small drill bit, around 1/16". 

                    <br>
                    Once the holes were drilled, I began placing the capacitors on the lexan, winding their legs through the holes. Then, I got to soldering the capacitors together, 
                    connecting the leads on the other side of the lexan, through the holes.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    June 2 2024
                    <br>
                    Finished soldering the capacitors together, then soldered the bleed resistors to the capacitor bank. Because the capacitor bank will almost certainly be charged to some 
                    percentage of the breakdown voltage of the spark gap, which is the point at which the spark gap fires and the circuit resonates, there needs to be a way to allow the 
                    capaitor bank to discharge after the circuit has been turned off. By attaching resistors of a relitvely high resistance between the two leads of each of the capacitors, 
                    allowing enough current to discharge the capacitor bank relatively quickly after it has been turned off, but not enough to hinder its performance. In my case, I used
                    10MOhm (5W?) resistors, between each of the twenty capacitors.
                    <br>
                    After the capacitors and resistors were soldered together, I added the four bolts and enough nuts to keep the lexan pieces properly spaced apart.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With the capacitor bank finished, I began work on the spark gap. The spark gap uses a series of 1" diameter copper tubes as the leads, so I cut nine of those at 2" long.
                    Then, I put each of them in a vise and marked where I was going to put the holes to mount them, about a (half inch?) from each end of the tube. Each hole was drilled at
                    at 0.25", through one side, in order to mount the copper tubes.

                    <br>
                    This week I finished up the spark gap. The spark gap design I chose to use is based off of "Scot's spark gap".
